- The OpenAI token is used to authenticate with the Akool API. It's a JWT token which can be generated using the Akool clientId and clientSecret. For more information, please refer to the [Akool API documentation](https://docs.akool.io/authentication/usage#get-the-token).
- The GPT token is used to authenticate with the GPT API. It's optional, but if you want to use the GPT chat, you need to provide a valid GPT token.
- The OpenAI token is required to generate the avatar.
- The GPT token is required to use the GPT chat.
- Most of the values are stored in the VideoChatContext.tsx file. It's a React context that provides the values to the components. You can change the values in the context to see the changes in the UI.
- The demo uses tailwindcss for styling and shadcn/ui for components. You can change the styles and components to your own.
